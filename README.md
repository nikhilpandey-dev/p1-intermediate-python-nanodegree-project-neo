    - Replacing default magic methods like `__str__` , `__repr__` with your own custom implementation.
    - Creating Subclasses.
1. Reading and writing files (File I/O) to and fro disk, especially:
    - Reading CSV files from disk in Dict format
    - Writing dicts to disk in CSV format.
    - Reading JSON files from disk
